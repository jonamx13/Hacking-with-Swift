/**
 MARK: If we create an employee as a constant using let,
 Swift makes the employee and all its data constant.
 We can call functions just fine, but those functions shouldn't be allowed
 to change the struct's data because we made it constant (2)
 
 Swift makes us take an extra step:
 any functions that only read data are fine as they are,
 but any that change data belonging to the struct
 must be marked with a special keyword : "mutating" (1)
